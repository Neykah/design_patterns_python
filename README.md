# Design Patterns in Python - Code Examples

This repository contains small code snippets used in the series of presentations on `Design Patterns in Python` for Ridge-i, Inc. in 2021.
These lectures cover the book [Dive Into Design Patterns](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/43125355-dive-into-design-patterns#:~:text=The%20book%20Dive%20Into%20Design,applying%20one%20of%20the%20patterns.), by Alexander Shvets. The structure of the lectures, diagrams and examples are largely inspired by the book itself.
The Python implementation of each example is an original work, distributed under MIT license.
Feel free to re-use them for any work or educational purpose.
